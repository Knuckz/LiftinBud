# LiftinBud
1/4/2020 - I'm thinking now that we don't have seperate pages for creation and just add a button on the exercise/workouts page.

1/2/2020 - I like the idea of being able to edit a workout/exercise while viewing your current workout. I would want flexability. Maybe a typeahead with autofill for the other fields, and if the user wants can just create a new exercise in the workout. workout would be saved that way.

instead of create dropdown I think I like a create route with pills to select exercise or workout. Not crazy about dropdown, especially on mobile.
